All my computer configuration to support my computer usage workflows, as a software developer and terminal nerd.

*Update 2020-01-27*: I've just heavy refactored, replacing much custom bash with GNU stow.

My setup is opionated:

* It's minimalist and elistist.
* I don't use a desktop environment (DE).
* I use a tiler (`dwm`).
* I like suckless programs.
* I use archlinux.
* neovim is gods text editor.
* My key bindings are unusual (thx ErgoDox EZ).
