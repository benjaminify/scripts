All my program configuration in one place. This small set of programs is optimised to my computer use workflows, as a software developer, security researcher and terminal nerd.

This repo experienced a major refactoring in late January 2020, large hunks of custom bash and inconsistency file structures have been replaced (and simplified) with GNU stow.

My setup is opionated:

* It's minimalist and elistist.
* I don't use a desktop environment (DE).
* I use a tiler (tiling window manager) called `dwm`.
* I like suckless programs.
* I use Arch Linux.
* Vim keys everywhere.
* neovim is my editor.
* Many esoteric key bindings (thx ErgoDox EZ).
